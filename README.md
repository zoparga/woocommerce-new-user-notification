# woocommerce-new-user-notification
Send "New User Registration" email to specified user when new customer is created on WooCommerce.

Tip: 
- create an e-mail alias and forward it to webshop managers
- create a user with that email address
- add that user's username to this plugin 'specified_user-user_name' field
  
Now every time a new user is registered, everyone get the notification who is forwarded the (mail address) message.
